# Continuation Prompt for Support Issue Tracking Application

## Current Status: ✅ Foundation Complete - Ready for Feature Implementation

The support issue tracking application foundation is **fully functional** with working authentication, database initialization, and comprehensive documentation. Ready to begin core feature development.

## What's Working
- ✅ **Authentication**: Stytch B2B JWT authentication working properly (no more redirect loops)
- ✅ **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB initialized at startup via Next.js instrumentation
- ✅ **Multi-tenancy**: Partition strategy implemented with organizationId
- ✅ **Session Management**: User sessions with proper name/organization display
- ✅ **Development Environment**: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- ✅ **Documentation**: Comprehensive feature planning and technical specs

## Architecture Overview
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14+ App Router with Server Components/Actions
- **Auth**: Stytch B2B with JWT tokens (`stytch_session_jwt`, `tzv_b2b_token`)
- **Database**: Azure Cosmos DB with organizationId partition key
- **Pattern**: Server Actions as primary interaction model (minimal client-side JS)

## Key Files Structure
```
/app/(dashboard)/           # Authenticated dashboard routes
  layout.tsx               # Working auth check + navigation
/lib/
  /cosmos/                 # Database client and initialization  
  /stytch/                 # Authentication client/session management
/types/index.ts            # Complete TypeScript definitions
/docs/                     # Feature documentation

```

## Immediate Next Tasks (Ready to Implement)

### 1. Core Issue Management (Highest Priority)
**Goal**: Create basic issue CRUD functionality
```bash
# Recommended starting point
mkdir -p app/issues
touch app/issues/page.tsx        # Issue list page
touch app/issues/new/page.tsx    # Create issue form
touch app/issues/[id]/page.tsx   # Issue detail view
touch app/actions/issues.ts      # Issue server actions
```

**Tasks**:
- Issue list page with mock data table
- Issue creation form with Server Action
- Issue detail view with comments
- Basic customer management pages

### 2. User Assignment System
**Goal**: Enable assigning issues to team members
- User selection components
- Assignment tracking and history
- Workload balancing indicators

### 3. Issue Categories & Classification  
**Goal**: Flexible categorization with custom fields
- Category management interface
- Category-based issue templates
- Custom field support per category

## Planned Advanced Features (Documented & Ready)

### Phase 2 Features
- **Repeat Issue Tracking**: Pattern recognition and duplicate detection
- **Jira Integration**: Manual escalation to development team
- **Advanced Search**: Filtering, saved searches, full-text search
- **Email Notifications**: Issue updates and assignments

### Phase 3 Features  
- **Jira Bidirectional Sync**: Real-time webhook integration
- **File Attachments**: Azure Blob Storage integration
- **Time Tracking**: Billable hours and reporting
- **SLA Management**: Response time tracking and alerts

## Development Commands
```bash
# Start development
yarn dev

# Available but not required for basic development
yarn build
yarn lint  
yarn type-check
yarn init-db  # Manual database initialization (auto runs at startup)
```

## Environment Setup
Requires these environment variables (should already be configured):
```
AZURE_COSMOS_ENDPOINT=
AZURE_COSMOS_KEY=
AZURE_COSMOS_DATABASE_ID=
STYTCH_BUSINESS_PROJECT_ID=
STYTCH_BUSINESS_SECRET=  
NEXT_PUBLIC_STYTCH_BUSINESS_ORG_ID=
```

## Database Schema (Ready to Use)
All containers auto-created with proper partition keys:
- `organizations` - Organization/tenant data
- `users` - User accounts with Stytch integration
- `customers` - Customer/client information  
- `issues` - Support tickets (main entity to implement)
- `comments` - Issue comments and updates
- `categories` - Issue classification system

## Technical Patterns Established

### Server Actions Pattern
```typescript
// app/actions/issues.ts
'use server'

export async function createIssue(formData: FormData) {
  const session = await requireAuth()
  
  const issue = {
    title: formData.get('title') as string,
    organizationId: session.organizationId,
    // ... other fields
  }
  
  return await dbQueries.createItem<Issue>('issues', issue, session.organizationId)
}
```

### Database Queries Pattern
```typescript
// Extend lib/cosmos/queries.ts
export const issueQueries = {
  async getByOrganization(organizationId: string) {
    return await container.items
      .query({
        query: 'SELECT * FROM c WHERE c.organizationId = @orgId',
        parameters: [{ name: '@orgId', value: organizationId }]
      })
      .fetchAll()
  }
}
```

## Authentication Pattern (Working)
Based on tezvalet.web example - authentication returns `null` for failures instead of throwing, with redirect handled at layout level.

## Ready to Continue Development

**Recommended Starting Point**: Implement basic issue list page at `/app/issues/page.tsx` with a simple table showing mock issues. This validates the architecture and provides immediate visible progress.

**Next Session Goals**:
1. Create issue list page with mock data
2. Implement issue creation form  
3. Add issue detail view
4. Begin assignment system

The foundation is solid and well-documented. All architectural decisions are made, patterns established, and detailed specifications available in `/docs/` folder. Ready for productive feature development!
