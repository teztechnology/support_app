# Next Steps - Support Issue Tracking Application

## Immediate Next Steps (Ready to Continue)

### 1. Core Issue Management Implementation
The foundation is now solid with working authentication and database initialization. Ready to implement core issue functionality.

**Tasks:**
1. **Create Issue Management Pages**
   - `/issues` - List all issues with filtering
   - `/issues/[id]` - Issue detail view  
   - `/issues/new` - Create new issue form
   - `/issues/[id]/edit` - Edit issue form

2. **Implement Issue Server Actions**
   - `createIssue()` - Create new support ticket
   - `updateIssue()` - Update issue details
   - `assignIssue()` - Assign to user
   - `addComment()` - Add comments/updates
   - `closeIssue()` - Mark as resolved/closed

3. **Customer Management**
   - `/customers` - Customer list and management
   - `/customers/[id]` - Customer detail with issue history
   - Customer creation and editing forms

### 2. User Assignment System
Build on the existing user authentication to enable issue assignment.

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Update Issue schema with assignment fields
2. Create user selection components
3. Add assignment history tracking
4. Implement workload balancing indicators
5. Build assignment notification system

### 3. Issue Categories & Classification
Implement flexible categorization system for better organization.

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create category management interface
2. Build category selection components for issues
3. Implement custom fields per category
4. Add category-based templates
5. Create category reporting and analytics

## Development Approach

### Server Actions First
Continue using Server Actions as the primary interaction model:
```typescript
// Example: app/actions/issues.ts
'use server'

export async function createIssue(formData: FormData) {
  const session = await requireAuth()
  
  const issue = {
    title: formData.get('title') as string,
    description: formData.get('description') as string,
    customerId: formData.get('customerId') as string,
    organizationId: session.organizationId,
    // ...
  }
  
  return await dbQueries.createItem<Issue>('issues', issue, session.organizationId)
}
```

### Component Structure
Build reusable components following existing patterns:
```
/components/
  /issues/
    IssueList.tsx
    IssueCard.tsx  
    IssueForm.tsx
    IssueComments.tsx
  /customers/
    CustomerList.tsx
    CustomerCard.tsx
  /shared/
    StatusBadge.tsx
    PriorityBadge.tsx
    UserAvatar.tsx
```

### Database Queries
Extend the existing query pattern in `/lib/cosmos/queries.ts`:
```typescript
export const issueQueries = {
  async getByOrganization(organizationId: string, filters?: IssueFilters) {
    // Implementation
  },
  
  async getByCustomer(organizationId: string, customerId: string) {
    // Implementation  
  },
  
  async getAssignedToUser(organizationId: string, userId: string) {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

## Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization
1. **Pagination**: Implement cursor-based pagination for large issue lists
2. **Caching**: Use React cache for frequently accessed data
3. **Indexing**: Ensure proper Cosmos DB indexes for query patterns
4. **Loading States**: Implement proper loading and skeleton states

### Security & Permissions
1. **Row-Level Security**: Ensure users only see issues for their organization
2. **Action Permissions**: Validate permissions before allowing issue modifications
3. **Data Validation**: Use Zod schemas for all form inputs
4. **Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for API actions

### User Experience
1. **Real-time Updates**: Consider implementing real-time updates for issue changes
2. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Add keyboard navigation for power users
3. **Bulk Operations**: Enable bulk issue assignment and status changes
4. **Mobile Responsive**: Ensure all interfaces work well on mobile devices

## Sample Implementation Order

### Week 1: Core Issue CRUD
1. Basic issue list page with Server Component
2. Issue creation form with Server Action
3. Issue detail view with comments
4. Basic customer management

### Week 2: Assignment & Categories  
1. User assignment functionality
2. Category management system
3. Category-based issue templates
4. Assignment notifications

### Week 3: Enhanced Features
1. Advanced filtering and search
2. Issue status workflow
3. Basic reporting dashboard
4. Email notifications

### Week 4: Polish & Testing
1. Error handling and validation
2. Performance optimization
3. Mobile responsiveness
4. User testing and feedback

## Ready to Start

The application is now in a solid state with:
- ✅ Authentication working properly
- ✅ Database initialization at startup
- ✅ User session management
- ✅ Multi-tenant architecture
- ✅ Development environment configured

**Recommended first task**: Implement the basic issue list page at `/issues` with a simple table showing mock issues, then gradually build out the full CRUD functionality.

This will validate the architecture and provide immediate visible progress while building toward the more advanced features like assignment and categorization.
